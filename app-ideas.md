## App Ideas 

### Voice Based Note Sharing

When there are a few busy adults in the household doing shopping, the coordination becomes a task on it's own, in which one often ends up with duplicates or missed items.  And the last thing you'd like to do at the end of your busy day is to run to a grocery store with small children in a tow.

This app is meant to minimize the shopping list maintenance effort and maximize one's use in time.

The application holds a set of simple categorized note entries, with easy voice enabled entry creation, update, and deletion.  Each entry can hold multiple tag data, which may represent simple annotation or complex related data such as Date (when do you need the item by?), Location (which store to buy?) etc.

App Features:
  * Simple and efficient data creation, sorting, and management
  * Easy synchronization between multiple instances of the app.
  * Reminders, based on the date, priority, location, etc.


Note, the only reference I found for speech-to-text iOS library is SpeechKit, in [here|https://www.raywenderlich.com/60870/building-ios-app-like-siri].  Wonder if there are any alternatives.

### Translation Plugin

When you are socializing with someone from a different country via a social app, it would be fun to add a few words or phrases in their native language.  Unfortunately, the current translation technology available on mobile makes it easy to detect a foreign language and translate it into your language, but not vice versa.

This application makes it easy to associate a certain entity with a certain language (say, your co-worker with Spanish), and, provides a easy pop-up to replace selected words or phrases with a direct translation of that language.  

The key trick here is to be able to do this replacement in the context of the social app.  There are always web sites to translate, but it is often too much work to do copy-and-paste and application swap in mobile just to get the right version of "hello".
